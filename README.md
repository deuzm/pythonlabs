## Some useful links I used to prepare for Lab 1(v 0.0.1)

### Git
* [Gitflow]( https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) -- learning the methodology.
* [Git How To](https://githowto.com/) -- learning some basic comands.
* [Learning git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)-- resource with visual tasks to practice commands and enhance understanding.
### Linux
* [The Unix Programming Environment -- Kernighan](https://scis.uohyd.ac.in/~apcs/itw/UNIXProgrammingEnvironment.pdf) -- a good book for understanding Unix and basic commands.
* [Open net Unix resource](https://www.opennet.ru/docs/RUS/unix_basic/) -- resource in Russian with a lot of detail.
### Docker 
* [Learning Docker](https://habr.com/ru/company/ruvds/blog/438796/) -- amazing resource for uderstanding Docker, starts with basic analogies, but progresses to a sophisticated level. Moreover it's in Russian.
* [Docker documentation]( https://docs.docker.com/) -- most of the references to get things done are from this recource.

### Python
For this lab there where not very much coding so mostly I used stackoverflow answers.
